<body>

Welcome. These are the guidelines of [\#\#abgilpqt+ at freenode](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/##abgilpqt+).

Everyone is welcome as long as they are respectful. This includes also 
non-ABGILPQT+ people in case they want to help or have friend or relative 
who is ABGILPQT+ etc.

Oh and **ABGILPQT+ means A\*, Bi\*, Gays, Intersex, Lesbians, Pan\*, Queers, Trans\* and everyone else.**

## Be respectful

* Please don't misgender people.
    * If you don't know what pronouns to use, please use [gender neutral ones.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#Alternatives_to_generic_he)
    * See also [our pronouns.](https://etherpad.fr/p/pronouns_abgilpqt+)
    * This also includes words like "guy", "man", "bro" and others like them.
    * But according to DICTIONARY they are gender neutral.
        * Are masculinity and being male gender neutral and default for 
        everyone?
* Do not be racist, albeist, anti-ABGILPQT+, classist, sexist, …
    * In case you don't agree with this, please leave this channel and 
    [freenode until you agree their policies too.](http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#offtopic)
* Don't log this channel publicly. 

## Getting help

In case there is an channel emergency (abusive user, spammer…, there are 
several ways to get help.

* PM or highlight someone who is on the access list which you can see with 
`/msg ChanServ access ##abgilpqt+ list`.
* `/msg Limnoria channel alert ##abgilpqt+ <the issue>`
    * Do note that all ops might not be identified to Limnoria.
* `/msg MemoServ sendops ##abgilpqt+ <the issue>`
    * Note that this command requires you to be identified with NickServ!
* Go to #freenode and tell that there is an issue at ##abgilpqt+ and tell 
them what the issue is.
    * `*!*@freenode/staff/*` has the op flags, so they are authorized to 
    take action if required.

## Other things

You might be asked to tell yourself about a little, but you don't have to 
tell us anything you don't want to.

* Mark NSFW and possibly Triggering links with `[NSFW]` or `[TW]` or 
`[TRIGGER WARNING]`.
* Please do not bring your own bots without permission.
    * `Limnoria` is used for channel management and `horo` (which actually 
    is normal irssi with LastFM script) have permission.
