We are channel for all gender and sexual minorities. ABGILPQT+ means

Trans\* and everyone else.

2014-03-20 can probably be named as the day when the channel was born
as on that day Mikaela was asking pinkieval if they knew about any channel
for asexuals.

They then realized there were no active channels for asexuals, or for
gender and sexual minorities in general. This is why they decided to create
one.

Then there was the question of which order to use for letters and Mikaela
wanted alphabedical order which then was took. The logs don't tell the
exact time when the channel was made, but the discussion ended around an
hour and half later.

*You might notice that \#\#abgilpqt+ was registered on 2014-05-03
instead of 2014-03-20. This is because the channel name was originally
different (`I` letter was missing from the name, so we moved. The move had
opposition, but we couldn't just drop `I` out. It's also included by other
people who talk about LGBTIQ+.*
