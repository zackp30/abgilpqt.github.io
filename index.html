<p>Welcome. These are the guidelines of <a href="ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/##abgilpqt+">##abgilpqt+ at freenode</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome as long as they are respectful. This includes also non-ABGILPQT+ people in case they want to help or have friend or relative who is ABGILPQT+ etc.</p>
<p><strong>ABGILPQT+ means Aces, Bi*, Gays, Intersex, Lesbians, Pan*, Queers, Trans* and everyone else.</strong></p>
<h2 id="be-respectful">Be respectful</h2>

</ul></li>
<li>Do not publicly log this channel.</li>

<h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2>
<p>In case there is a channel emergency (abusive user, spammer etc.), there are several ways to get help.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>PM or highlight someone who is opped or on the access list which you can see with <code>/msg ChanServ access ##abgilpqt+ list</code>.</li>
<li><code>/msg Limnoria channel alert ##abgilpqt+ &lt;the issue&gt;</code>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Note that not all ops might be identified to Limnoria.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>/ms sendops ##abgilpqt+ &lt;the issue&gt;</code>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Note that this command requires you to be identified with NickServ and have +A flag (if you are voiced, you most likely have it)!</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Go to <code>#freenode</code>, the freenode support channel, and tell freenode staff that there is an issue in <code>##abgilpqt+</code> (and also tell what the issue is).
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Freenode staff have op flags, so they are authorized to take action if required.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-things">Other things</h2>
<p>You might be asked to tell yourself about a little, but you don't have to tell us anything you don't want to.</p>
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Mark NSFW and possibly triggering links with <code>[NSFW]</code> or <code>[TW]</code> or <code>[TRIGGER WARNING]</code>.</li>
<li>Please do not bring your own bots without permission.
<ul class="incremental">
<li><code>Limnoria</code> is used for channel management and <code>horo</code> (which actually is normal irssi with LastFM script) have permission.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People who are regulars on the channel are voiced if they have talked about themselves and haven't had (behaviournal) issues.
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Op consideration takes priority in voicing questions.</li>
<li><a href="https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#userregistration">Please also register your nick so we can voice you</a>!
<ul class="incremental">
<li>Note that sometimes we have quiet set on unidentified users. To see if that is the case check if <code>$~a</code> appears in <code>/mode ##abgilpqt+ +q</code>. If you are identified to services, this doesn't apply to you.
<ul class="incremental">
<li>You can see if you are identified by running <code>/whois yournick</code>. It should have a line telling <code>yournick is logged in as youraccountname</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
