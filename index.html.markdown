<body>

Welcome. These are the guidelines of [\#\#abgilpqt+ at freenode](ircs://chat.freenode.net:6697/##abgilpqt+).

Everyone is welcome as long as they are respectful. This includes also
non-ABGILPQT+ people in case they want to help or have friend or relative
who is ABGILPQT+ etc.

**ABGILPQT+ means Aces, Bi\*, Gays, Intersex, Lesbians, Pan\*,
Queers, Trans\* and everyone else.**

## Be respectful

* Do not misgender people.
    * If you don't know what pronouns to use, please use [gender neutral ones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns#Alternatives_to_generic_he).
    * See also [our pronouns](https://etherpad.fr/p/pronouns_abgilpqt+).
    * This also includes words like "guy", "man", "bro" and others like
      them, even if the dictionary lists them as being gender-neutral.
* Do not be racist, albeist, anti-ABGILPQT+, classist, sexist etc
    * In case you don't agree with this, please leave this channel and
    [freenode until you agree their policies too](http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#offtopic).
* Do not publicly log this channel.

## Getting help

In case there is a channel emergency (abusive user, spammer etc.), there
are several ways to get help.

* PM or highlight someone who is opped or on the access list which you
can see with `/msg ChanServ access ##abgilpqt+ list`.
* `/msg Limnoria channel alert ##abgilpqt+ <the issue>`
    * Note that not all ops might be identified to Limnoria.
* `/ms sendops ##abgilpqt+ <the issue>`
    * Note that this command requires you to be identified with NickServ
      and have +A flag (if you are voiced, you most likely have it)!
* Go to `#freenode`, the freenode support channel, and tell freenode staff
  that there is an issue in `##abgilpqt+` (and also tell what the issue
  is).
    * Freenode staff have op flags, so they are authorized to take action
      if required.

## Other things

You might be asked to tell yourself about a little, but you don't have to
tell us anything you don't want to.

* Mark NSFW and possibly triggering links with `[NSFW]` or `[TW]` or
  `[TRIGGER WARNING]`.
* Please do not bring your own bots without permission.
    * `Limnoria` is used for channel management and `horo` (which actually
    is normal irssi with LastFM script) have permission.
* People who are regulars on the channel are voiced if they have talked
  about themselves and haven't had (behaviournal) issues.
    * Op consideration takes priority in voicing questions.
    * [Please also register your nick so we can voice you](https://freenode.net/faq.shtml#userregistration)!
